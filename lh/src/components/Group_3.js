			  Mindvalley founder Vishen Lakhiani became a parent over 12 years ago. Almost immediately, 
			  he made a commitment to approach his parenting journey in the same way he approaches personal 
			  growth: by questioning many of the preconceived notions surrounding parenting. And seeking out 
			  new knowledge and perspectives that could help him raise his children with greater love, 
			  compassion, and competence.
			  <br/><br/>
			  Then, he met Renee Airya and Akira Chan, whose shared passion for parenting led to the Little 
			  Humans project: a global initiative to seek out the world’s best parenting experts, and share 
			  their knowledge across the globe.
			  <br/><br/>
			  Mindvalley is thrilled to add the subject of parenting to our curriculum. Parenting is an 
			  incredible opportunity to not just nurture a child who’ll go on to make their own positive 
			  impact on the world – but also to explore our true selves, and discover skills, passions, 
			  and gifts we never knew we had.
