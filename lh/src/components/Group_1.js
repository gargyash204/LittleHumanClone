			<h3 className="mv-type--headline5 mt-5 mb-5 text-center">An Urgent Solution To An Uncertain Situation</h3>
			<p className="mv-type--body1 mt-5">If you’re like most parents, you’ve got a 
			lot on your plate right now. Your child is at home, you’re managing both their 
			schoolwork and their free time, and you’re trying to help them cope with the changes 
			happening around them - all as your own life is shifting rapidly.
			<br/><br/>
			Now more than ever, every <strong>conversation</strong> you have with your child is crucial...
			<br/><br/>
			Every <strong>activity and exercise</strong> you set up for them…
			<br/><br/>
			Every <strong>rule and boundary</strong> you put in place...
			<br/><br/>
			And even <strong>every example you set</strong> through your own words, actions, and emotions.
			<br/><br/>
			Trying to navigate everything is challenging and overwhelming. 
			<br/><br/>
			For instance, how do you know you’re making the right calls? Giving the right advice? 
			And taking the right steps to instill habits and beliefs that uplift your child throughout 
			their lives, instead of drag them down?
			<br/><br/>
			The Little Humans Membership is our way of keeping you connected to the knowledge and 
			perspectives you need to make your best decisions as a parent - and it all begins with 
			a parenting framework we call <strong>Transformational Parenting</strong>.

			className="imging1 lazyload rounded mx-auto block w-full mt-5 mb-5" alt="Multiratial families 
			enjoy some quality time together at home"/>
			<p className="mv-type--body1 mt-8">At Little Humans, the experts and knowledge we curate are 
			all based on six ‘pillars’ that form the foundation of an effective and compassionate parent. 
			We call this framework Transformational Parenting - because once you apply it in your own 
			personal way, it will transform how you nurture your child for the better.</p>
			<ol className="mv-list__basic mt-10">
			 <li>
			  <h6 className="mv-type--headline7">Parental Beliefs</h6>
				<p className="mv-type--body1 mt-1">Whether it’s your spiritual beliefs, or your beliefs about life, 
				self-love, friendship, morality and more: your beliefs as a parent will profoundly influence 
				your child. As a Transformational Parent, you will learn to become more conscious of your 
				belief systems.</p>
			 </li>
			 <li className="mt-8">
			  <h6 className="mv-type--headline7">Emotional Intelligence</h6>
				<p className="mv-type--body1 mt-1">Emotional intelligence telegraphs how well you’re 
				teaching your kids to express themselves emotionally, and also how well you’re leading by example. 
				You’ll learn how to give them a safe space to share their feelings - which includes leading 
				by example.</p>
			 </li>
			 <li className="mt-8">
			 <h6 className="mv-type--headline7">Routines & Rituals</h6>
			 <p className="mv-type--body1 mt-1">From mealtime to playtime to bedtime, children thrive on 
			 positive routines. One of the Transformational Parenting philosophies you’ll learn is to 
			 create Genuine Encounter Moments (GEMS) with your children through routines and rituals.</p>
			</li>
			<li className="mt-8">
			 <h6 className="mv-type--headline7">External Influences</h6>
			  <p className="mv-type--body1 mt-1">External influences like family members, teachers, your community, 
			  the media, and friends leave a huge impact on your child’s upbringing. You’ll explore how to 
			  manage those influences so your child enjoys healthy relationships with the people and 
			  institutions around them.</p>
			</li>
			<li className="mt-8">
			 <h6 className="mv-type--headline7">Parent To Parent Relationship</h6>
			  <p className="mv-type--body1 mt-1">Our children are watching us, looking for clues on how to 
			  act and what to believe. It’s our duty to show them a good example of what a healthy 
			  relationship looks like. Which includes making a conscious decision to say or do 
			  (or NOT to say or do) certain things in front of them.</p>
			</li>
			<li className="mt-8">
			<h6 className="mv-type--headline7">Education & Growth</h6>
			 <p className="mv-type--body1 mt-1">We live in an era where parents have unprecedented 
			 access to education, and limitless opportunities for growth. As a Transformational Parent, 
			 you’ll learn how to make learning an adventure that’s both fun and fulfilling for your children 
			 and you.</p>
