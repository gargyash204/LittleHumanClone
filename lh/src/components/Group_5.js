        					I absolutely enjoyed my Little Humans experience. As a mom of two, who has 
        					spent her whole life working with children, I cannot praise the content of the 
        					lessons enough. The bite-sized episodes are so packed with layers upon layers of 
        					parenting advice, knowledge, wisdom and assurances that you walk away with more 
        					than you bargained for. I have the privilege of being familiar with the conscious 
        					approach to parenting, through the works of Rhea Lalla and Dr. Shefali Tsabary, 
        					among others. Yet the Little Humans series gave me so much more to explore. Each 
        					episode reinforced tenets of conscious parenting in its own way, yet contributed to
        					 expansive growth and paradigm shifts. It empowers us with the knowledge to 
        					 raise our children consciously and not by default. From preparing and nourishing 
        					 your body during pregnancy, to feeding your babies through childhood. From parenting
        					  consciously beyond the discipline model to creating bedtime rituals and to 
        					  making education fun. From co-parenting to managing death, loss, and 
        					  disappointment, Little Humans covers it all. It would have taken me a 
        					  lifetime to gather all the knowledge and gains offered. Now, I’m entering the 
        					  next season of parenting with a stronger foundation under my feet and powerful 
        					  wings of confidence. We’ve always been told there’s no handbook for parenting. 
        					  Finally, with Little Humans, we have one! I couldn’t have asked for a more thorough 
        					  and insightful experience.
