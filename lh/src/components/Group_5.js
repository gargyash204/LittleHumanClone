        					parenting advice, knowledge, wisdom and assurances that you walk away with more 
        					than you bargained for. I have the privilege of being familiar with the conscious 
        					approach to parenting, through the works of Rhea Lalla and Dr. Shefali Tsabary, 
        					among others. Yet the Little Humans series gave me so much more to explore. Each 
        					episode reinforced tenets of conscious parenting in its own way, yet contributed to
        					 expansive growth and paradigm shifts. It empowers us with the knowledge to 
        					 raise our children consciously and not by default. From preparing and nourishing 
        					 your body during pregnancy, to feeding your babies through childhood. From parenting
        					  consciously beyond the discipline model to creating bedtime rituals and to 
        					  making education fun. From co-parenting to managing death, loss, and 
        					  disappointment, Little Humans covers it all. It would have taken me a 
        					  lifetime to gather all the knowledge and gains offered. Now, I’m entering the 
        					  next season of parenting with a stronger foundation under my feet and powerful 
        					  wings of confidence. We’ve always been told there’s no handbook for parenting. 
        					  Finally, with Little Humans, we have one! I couldn’t have asked for a more thorough 
        					  and insightful experience.</p><br/>

                  <p>I am the kind of parent who is constantly seeking resources that would be helpful to deal with my responsibilities. And I believe most of Mindvalley students are like that. So, when I was offered to test the “Little Humans” channel, I was very enthusiastic, because it gave me access to many of these resources in one place. And my expectations were more than met. I think this channel is unique in terms of delivering the message of leading experts in different aspects of parenting. And even while I was quite familiar with some of them, Renee and Akira were able to explore new angles of their expertise in the interviews for the program. I feel like I really have significantly expanded the wealth of knowledge with regards to parenting I can profit from. We often say that there is no course or certification program that prepares people to the challenges of parenting. And I think that Mindvalley found a great format that could be truly called a school for parents.

I even healed my emotions towards my family and got to see them as "the village" for raising my children. I got answers on how to my ADD and my child's ADHD as a gift, instead of a problem. I got a much clearer image of how a conscious family looks like and practical advice on how to achieve that. At the end of the program, I have so many great resources and insights! Moreover, I have a vision for my family, which I never thought necessary before, but now I feel it's blissful. I hope that one day, all the parents will be given the gift to go through programs like Little Humans, so their lives would have much more perspective, their struggle would make more sense and their actions would heal future generations.

<p>Please don’t let the “Little Humans” name fool you.</p> 
<p>Everyone I know who has encountered the broad spectrum of topics offered in the LH subscription would 
highly recommend LH to everyone. As Dr. Shefali teaches in her revolutionary Conscious Parenting Mastery 
(CPM) quest, there is a little human in us all. Im certain that every conscious human, large and small, 
young or old alike, will agree that every journey is best made by following a roadmap. LH was a beautiful 
find on my own life path. In every LH lesson I have enjoyed, there is a gem... a genuine emotional encounter, 
a blessing.</p> 

<p>These lessons break down and skillfully consolidate massive amounts of life-enhancing human data 
with playful, lighthearted humor as well as with loving compassion and empathy. We are all One, and that 
thread of human-beingness is brilliantly woven throughout each course in broken down, easy to digest 
“mind-meals” followed by practical “how-to” suggestions on assimilating the very human, frequently 
challenging topics.</p> 

<p>My favorite takeaway so far: words fuel resistance. So along with that line, I think it’s time to 
say goodbye for now, and I would encourage you to join me as I use LH lessons up-level my consciousness. 
To your self-care, (a LH bonus) and to your Joy!</p>
<p>Much❤️ ... because Joy is your birthright.

<p>What I love is that the information, whilst obviously applicable to parenting, is so valuable in terms of personal development both for myself and my sons. I was hoping to expand my parenting general knowledge with Little Humans, following the amazing and transformative Conscious Parenting Mastery Quest with Dr Shefali. I have received so much more than expected! Real actionable insights for all areas of my life. Well done! The flow between CPM and Little Humans is seamless and I love that the “episodes” are broken down into bite sized “lessons”. An unexpectedly magical experience.
